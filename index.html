		· Intention
		 <br>&nbsp  Because I like using solid-colored fresh image style, and I am learning HTML and JavaScript, I would like to develop a game with such character as Web homework. Inspired by OLO(a mobile game), my classmate and I decided to transform it into web game to experience the development of a complete gaming.

		<br><br>· My Personal Contribution 
		<br>&nbsp   This is a group project that I cooperate with another classmate. I am responsible for the mode writing of 2nd  players and 4th players, and my classmate is responsible for writing the on-line version of the game. (The on-line version of the game is not available in the content in the link)

		<br><br>· What I’ve Learned     
		<br>&nbsp   During writing Colliball, I fully learned how to write a game-related Web page (HTML, CSS, js), mastered the usage of game engine (an open source 2D engine called LufyLegend is applied in the process of writing). I learned to communicate with the developers because during the writing I have mailed the engine developer and game developer. I am indebted to those developers who gave me a lot of help.

		<br><br>· Platform Requirement
		<br>&nbsp   Any platforms which can get access to network (Windows, Mac) and on which mobile phones can run.

		<br><br>· How To Install
		<br>&nbsp   Just need to unzip and open the file (index.html) then you can start the game.

		· Intention
		 <br>&nbsp  I want to learn to use the Unity3D engine, and accumulate experience of designing and writing games. By chance my second degree (digital entertainment design) classmates wanted to develop a game, so we decided to build a team, to experience the development of a complete gaming.

		<br><br>· My Personal Contribution 
		<br>&nbsp   Our team consists of four members. All staff are involved in the game design discussions. One of us is responsible for the visual design. Another and I are responsible for the game script writing.

		<br><br>· What I’ve Learned     
		<br>&nbsp   In the very beginning of investigation about Parkour game-related content, I learned a lot of valuable experience and perspective from other developers (students and similar games developers). In the process of designing playing method, I learned to express my ideas to others, and also gained lots of highlights from other people's thoughts and ideas. I learned how to use the Unity3D engine and master the c # game script writing. We needed to take the game to attend TENCENT MINIGAME College Students' Creative Competition which there was a deadline, so I learned how to arrange a reasonable game development schedule, which kept us from being hurried before deadline.

		· Introduction
		 <br>&nbsp  Bicolor is a 2-color puzzle game. The gamer should use the arrow key to control the color bar, draw the interface and let it be the same color. I write this game by assembly language in order to master the language and enhance my programming capability.
